### üë®‚Äçüíª Tyler's Coding Journey

 
&nbsp;&nbsp;I started my coding journey in 2020 when I started attending Lewis-Clark State College. When I first started I had no idea what degree I wanted to pursue, but I decided to try out some programming classes my first semester. I did this because I have always liked video games and computers, and I quickly learned that I really enjoyed programming! I then started to take classes in Python, C, C++, SQL, R, and many other types of languages and tools. About two years into my Computer Science Bachelor's degree Lewis-Clark State College started offering a Cybersecurity Management Bachelor's as well. My advisor told me about it and said I should try some cybersecurity and networking classes since the credits would count towards my computer science degree anyway. So I did! I then started taking cybersecurity, networking, and some business classes. During this time I even got an internship where I was a Cyber Defense Analyst and I was investigating security incidents and mitigating the threats on our client's networks. Since I was enjoying cybersecurity as well, I decided that I would complete this Bachelor's degree as well as my Computer Science degree. So in May of 2024 I completed my Bachelor of Science, Computer Science and I would go back for one more semester, and in December of 2024 I would complete my Bachelor of Science, Cybersecurity Management. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with two bachelor's, an internship, and several projects under my belt I am currently looking for a full-time job. I have been pretty busy doing this but I still want to make sure I am programming as much as possible! Currently, I am making a game in Unity using C# and I hope I can publish it on Steam eventually! Thanks for reading, please reach out if you want to collab on a project or have any questions/comments!
